2.	My GitHub account's repository and clone's name is Amiyahvbest.github.io. 
3.	I haven't did much with the repository I created just yet. It contains a folder and a clone. I just did what was instructed of me so far. 
4. I created the repository by selecting the plus sign, selecting 'Create New Repository', naming it, and selecting add README.md file. After creating, I used the first two steps to clone it.
